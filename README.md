# CG-AI
Criz Games' AI Library for Unity.
 
It is not meant to be used by other people, but if you want to use it, feel free to do so!
Also, it is not the fastest library, but fast enough for my purposes.
 
## Installation
In the Unity package manager, click on the plus sign > Add package from Git URL..  
`https://github.com/CrizGames/CG-AI.git`
